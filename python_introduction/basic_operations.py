#Create a file named basic_operations.py.
#In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
#You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
#Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
#Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Additon of number1 and number 2
sum = number1 + number2

#Subraction 
difference = number2 - number1

#Multiplication
product = number1 * number2

##Display results
print("The sum of ", number1 ,"and ",  number2, 'is', sum )
print("The difference of ", number1 ,"and ",  number2, 'is ', difference )
print("The product of ", number1 ,"and ",  number2, 'is', product )
